# Breath Easy

Ever been curious to know what the air quality around a hiking trail is, but you don't know the GPS location on hand? What about being on a roadtrip and wondering what the air quality is going to be like in the next few cities over, but you have no idea what any of them are called. With this app, you can use the power of Google Maps and Air Visual with ease! Simply click on anywhere on the map and behold! The results are right there.

Note: This is a work in progress and the Google API is currently expired. The Screenshot shown is what's currently in developement and differs greatly from the demo.
